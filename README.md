Send a SMS message using Twilio API.

You will need to go to https://www.twilio.com/ first and sign up for one of their free accounts. Once you have an account you will also need to verify your number as well as 'purchase' a phone number to use. It is all free of cost. I suppose if you use it a TON they might charge you portions of a penny but with normal use it will be free. There are a ton of docs on their website to check out. You can use Twilio to do a lot of SMS things as well as What's App.
They will supply you keys and tokens that you will use in the program. Just add them to the variables and change the phone numbers and presto! You can send a text from your computer. I verified my wife's number and now I can quickly send her a text while on my computer without touching my phone. Pretty darn cool!
